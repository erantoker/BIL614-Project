	abstract = {An increasing fraction of the global discourse is migrating online in the form of blogs, bulletin boards, web pages, wikis, editorials, and a dizzying array of new collaborative technologies. The migration has now proceeded to the point that topics reflecting certain individual products are sufficiently popular to allow targeted online tracking of the ebb and flow of chatter around these topics. Based on an analysis of around half a million sales rank values for 2,340 books over a period of four months, and correlating postings in blogs, media, and web pages, we are able to draw several interesting conclusions.First, carefully hand-crafted queries produce matching postings whose volume predicts sales ranks. Second, these queries can be automatically generated in many cases. And third, even though sales rank motion might be difficult to predict in general, algorithmic predictors can use online postings to successfully predict spikes in sales rank.},

	title = {Feasibility analysis for popularity prediction of stack exchange posts based on its initial content},
	abstract = {In technology related question and answer websites, people working on corresponding technologies post questions about the problems that they encounter and seek answers to them. The popular posts having greater views that stay active for longer periods of time are the ones that occur commonly for many users. The objective of this paper is to predict such posts at its arrival time. Using the prediction results, the problems that will gain popularity over time can be addressed before they become very common. The posts in question and answer websites have a longer lifespan than other online content such as news articles which are short lived and have a high user activity at the beginning that decrease with time. This indicates that the user activity in question and answer websites is not an accurate measure of popularity in an early stage. In this paper, we have used the initial content in a post as the predictors of popularity rather than using conventional methods such as shares, comments etc. We used three models to predict the popularity using the dataset of android.stackexchange.com, a popular question and answer website for android developers.},

	abstract = {News articles are extremely time sensitive by nature. There is also intense competition among news items to propagate as widely as possible. Hence, the task of predicting the popularity of news items on the social web is both interesting and challenging. Prior research has dealt with predicting eventual online popularity based on early popularity. It is most desirable, however, to predict the popularity of items prior to their release, fostering the possibility of appropriate decision making to modify an article and the manner of its publication. In this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional feature space derived from properties of an article and evaluate the efficacy of these features to serve as predictors of online popularity. We examine both regression and classification algorithms and demonstrate that despite randomness in human behavior, it is possible to predict ranges of popularity on twitter with an overall 84\% accuracy. Our study also serves to illustrate the differences between traditionally prominent sources and those immensely popular on the social web.},

The number of user supplied comments on a news article may be indicative of its importance or impact. We report on exploratory work that predicts the comment volume of news articles prior to publication using five feature sets. We address the prediction task as a two stage classification task: a binary classification identifies articles with the potential to receive comments, and a second binary classification receives the output from the first step to label articles "low" or "high" comment volume. The results show solid performance for the former task, while performance degrades for the latter.},
